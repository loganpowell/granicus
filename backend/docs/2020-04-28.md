# Schema

## Keys to keep and/or transform/migrate 

Desired stored/persisted format/schema of entries:

- <primary key: bulletin `id` (derived)><sort key: `created_at` (or `sent_at`)>
  - detail
    - unsubscribes (derived count from link clicks containing `one_click_unsubscribe`)
    - campaign (derived parsed from link text)
  - links
  - topics ([many:many] relationship @connection/@key <=> amplify)
    - subscribers

[many:many]: https://docs.amplify.aws/cli/graphql-transformer/directives#many-to-many-connections

Example of establishing many to many relationships using `@connection` and `key`

```graphql

type Post @model {
  id: ID!
  title: String!
  editors: [PostEditor] @connection(keyName: "byPost", fields: ["id"])
}

# Create a join model and disable queries as you don't need them
# and can query through Post.editors and User.posts
type PostEditor
  @model(queries: null)
  @key(name: "byPost", fields: ["postID", "editorID"])
  @key(name: "byEditor", fields: ["editorID", "postID"]) {
  id: ID!
  postID: ID!
  editorID: ID!
  post: Post! @connection(fields: ["postID"])
  editor: User! @connection(fields: ["editorID"])
}

type User @model {
  id: ID!
  username: String!
  posts: [PostEditor] @connection(keyName: "byEditor", fields: ["id"])
}

```

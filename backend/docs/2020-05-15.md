# Custom Resolvers in AWS Amplify

AWS Amplify generates the most common CRUD operations one
needs to get started creating their very own
cloud-first-DB-backed API on DynamoDB. This is fantastic for
getting started, but you may need to create a [`custom
resolver`] if you need anything more than single item per
operation CRUD. E.g.:

- batch operations
- all or nothing transacations 

In my case, I needed both of these features. Here's a
simplified illustration:

### relationships

- `campaign`
  - `bulletin`
    - `summary`
    - [`topic`]
    - [`link`]
- `topic`
  - [`bulletin`]

So we have the following relationship types:

- [1:1]
  - each `bulletin` can have one `summary` (subject, opens, clicks, etc.)
- [1:N]
  - each `campaign` can have many `bulletin`s
  - each `bulletin` can have many `link`s
- [N:1]
  - many `bulletin`s can _belong to_ a single `campaign`
- [N:N]
  - each `bulletin` can have many `topic`s (lists of subscribers) _and_
  - each `topic` can have many `bulletin`s

N:1 is distinct from 1:N as you can establish that a child
"belongs to" a parent during the creation of the child or
that a parent "has" some children during the creation of a
parent. This distinction is relevant to the need for custom
resolvers.

## Requirement #1: Transactions

In order to facilitate the N:N relationship of
[`topic`]:[`bulletin`], we create a [join] between them. This
is an explicitly created, but non-queryable, item that
serves only to allows `bulletin`s to be returned by their
`topic`s and vice-versa.

What this looks like in our schema:

```graphql

type Campaign @model {
  id                         : ID!
  bulletins                  : [Bulletin]       @connection (keyName: "byCampaign", fields: ["id"])
}

type Topic @model{
  id                         : ID!
  name                       : String
  bulletins                  : [BulletinTopic]  @connection (keyName: "byTopic", fields: ["id"])
}

type Bulletin
  @model
  @key(name: "byCampaign", fields: ["campaign_id", "created_at"]) 
{
  id                         : ID!
  campaign_id                : ID!           
  campaign                   : Campaign         @connection (fields: ["campaign_id"])
  created_at                 : AWSDateTime
  detail                     : BulletinDetail 
  links                      : [Link]           
  topics                     : [BulletinTopic]  @connection (keyName: "byBulletin", fields: ["id"])
}

## enable N:N relationship via a ref

type BulletinTopic 
  @model (queries: null)                       
  @key(name: "byBulletin", fields: ["bulletin_id", "topic_id"])
  @key(name: "byTopic",    fields: ["topic_id", "bulletin_id"]) 
{
  id                         : ID!
  bulletin_id                : ID!
  bulletin                   : Bulletin!        @connection (fields: ["bulletin_id"])
  topic_id                   : ID!
  topic                      : Topic!           @connection (fields: ["topic_id"])
  created_at                 : AWSDateTime

}


```

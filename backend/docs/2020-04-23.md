STACKED ONE AT A TIME
SOME STONES ARE LARGE
SOME STONES ARE SMALL

FEW MONOLITHS SURVIVE
A BLOCK CAN BE REUSED
A STONE CAN BE REBORN

ONE ON TOP OF ANOTHER
THE HUMBLE PARTS MADE
INTO A GIANT MONUMENT
GREATS WORKS ARE MADE

- `condSpawnCMD`: command that conditionally holds up the
  accumulation of the Task to spawn a subprocess for more
  async if condition met (e.g., `length === 20 && has_next_page`)

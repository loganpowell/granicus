/**

Removing object entries from the accumulator in a Command will not remove
them from the source object (even if done mutatively) in the Task because the
result of the Command is spread back into the source accumulator (available
between intra-Task Commands) it was passed, effectively undoing the prune.
You might also mutate the inter-command accumulator, but that could be
dangerous

ðŸ”¥ understand the inter-Command accumulator ðŸ”¥

In order to "prune" entries from the accumulator, you must do so at the
receiving end of the Task. In this case as a transducer function on the
output Channel
